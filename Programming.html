                <h3>Many modern languages are based around OOP, including Java, C++, Python & more<p>The basics are as followed:</h3>
                <ol class="spacing-small" style="text-align: left">
                    <li>Code is divided up into <b>objects</b> which contain variables (referred to as <b>attributes</b>) and functions (known as <b>methods</b>)</li>
                    <li>Objects are made from "blueprints" called <b>classes</b>. Objects are an instance of a class</li>
                    <li>Objects can interact with each other via <b>public</b> methods or attributes</li>
                    <li>Methods and attributes can be hidden from other classes by setting them as <b>private</b></li>
                    <li>The bundling of methods and attributes into objects with access control is called <b>encapsulation</b></li>
                </ol>
                <p></p>
                <p class="spacing-small">
                    Object oriented code works on dividing up projects into objects, consisting of attributes and
                    methods. Objects are instances of classes, and can interact with each other through public methods
                    or attributes. You can encapsulate methods and attributes into objects with access control.

                <h2>Types of Languages</h2>

                <h3>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act was passed in 2000.</h3>
                The main purpose of this act is to provide restraints for security services
                and the police when investigating and surveying digital data and communications of individuals.
                The act also makes it a crime for anyone unauthorised by the act to carry out surveilance and monitoring of communicatons.
                The European Court of Human Rights stated that UK surveillance laws were unclear and that there was nothing in place
                to prevent abuses of power by organisations regarding the interception of electronic communications.
                It was decided that UK surveillance laws and practice must be tighter in order to protect the individual's rights to privacy.
                As a result, the act was passed.
                <p>
                <p> The idea behind allowing these organisations to intercept and monitor comunications is to achieve the following:
                <ul class ="row text-left">
                    <li>Prevent or detect crimes</li>
                    <li>Prevent public disorder from occurring</li>
                    <li>To ensure national security and the safety of the general public</li>
                    <li>To investigate or detect any abnormal or illegal use of telecommunication systems.</li>
