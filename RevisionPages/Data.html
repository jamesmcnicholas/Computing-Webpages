            <h3>The computer misuse act came into effect in 1990. It was designed to restrict unauthorised and malicious use of computer systems.
                    The act makes it illegal to carry out any of the following:</h3>
          </p>
          <ol class="row text-left">
            <li>Unauthorised access to computer material</li>
            <li>Unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate a crime</li>
            <li>Unauthorised modification of computer material</li>
            <li>Making, supplying or obtaining anything which can be used in computer misuse offences</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="spacing-small">
            The act works in tiers, so each act has more severe consequences than the last. For example, <br> unauthorised modification of material has worse consequences than basic unauthorised access to data.<br> Before 1990, there was no protection
            against data theft or modification, meaning there was nothing that could be done <br> to punish cyber criminals. This act helped to fight it by giving the means to prosecute those who comitted such acts. <br><br> Click the image above to learn

          <h3> Bitwise Manipulation </h3>
          <div>
            <p class="paragraph-small">
              Bitwise operators can be used to compare and manipulate binary values.
              They consist of the symbols: & (and), | (or) and ^ (xor). These can
              be applied to binary values to compare bits in each position. For example,
              <b>0010 & 0110 would return 0010</b>, as that position is the only one that contains
              a '1' in both nibbles. On the other hand, <b>0010 | 0110 would return 0110</b>, as
              it returns a '1' for any position that contains at least one '1'. Lastly,
              <b>0010 ^ 0110 would return 0100</b>, as '1' is only returned when one or the other
              contains a '1' but not both
              <br><br>
              Other bitwise operators include 'bit shifters'. <b><<</b> will move
              every didgit one to the left, and <b>>></b> will move them one to the right.
              These can be applied in statements to <i>shift</i> bits more than one position.
              For example, 2 << 3 returns 16. This is because 2 can be represented as 0000 0010.
              Therefore, by shifting three places we get 0001 0000, which is 16 in binary.
            </p>

          <h3> Drawing logic diagrams </h3>
          Logic statements can be represented by drawing diagrams. Each 'gate' has a symbol, as shown below.<br><br>

          <h3>Boolean theory can be applied to lots ot real world situations</h3>

            <div id="first" padding-left="10px">
              Shown to the right is a <i>bistable latch</i> using NOR gates. the
              purpose of this circuit is to hold its value until the other input is activated.
              For example, once it has been turned on, pressing the on button again will do nothing.
              It's not until the off button is pressed that the output of the circuit changes.

              This circuit works by utilising two NOR gates and feeding the output of each into
              the other. By default, the system is turned off. As soon as S is activated,
              the bottom NOR gate deactivates, as one of its inputs is on. This deactivates
              the path leading to the top gate. This means both of the top inputs are off,
              turning on the output, Q. As the output from the top NOR leads to the bottom NOR gate,
              its 'on' state is preserved. The reverse happens when R is triggered to turn the system off.

              Other applications contain hundreds of possibilities, including flip flops and adders.
              A half-adder contains the gates required to add two binary digits. The digits are input
              and fed into the an XOR gate. If both digits are a zero or one, the result is zero. If
              both the digits are ones, the result for carry is one. Both the sum and carry digits
              are returned. A full adder is capable of taking this output and using it to add
              longer binary strings.
