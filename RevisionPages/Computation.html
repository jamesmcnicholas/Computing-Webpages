            Graphs can be divided into two categories - Directed and undirected.
            Directed graphs have direction (in the form of arrows) showing the
            path to take. Undirected graphs do not have this propterty, meaning
            there is no outlined path. Trees can be referred to as <b>minimally
            connected directed graphs</b> with only one path from the root node
            to any other node. This works because trees come under the over-arching
            title of graphs.

              Merge sorts are very effective at tackling large data sets. Their ability to break down the data into chunks
              and sort those greatly reduces the number of iterations needed. However,
              the sort is more intensive than others, and is not as effective as say, a bubble
              sort on much smaller data sets due to this.

                <li>7. Add the new sublist to the start of the queue </li>
                <li>8. If the queue has more than one item left, return to stage 2</li>
                <li>9. If the queue only has one item list, you are done - that sublist is the sorted list </li>

              The quicksort is efficient at sorting items, but is also easy to implement
              It is widely used sort for lists of any size, however can become
              slower when sorting large lists if the chosen pivot is unsuccessful.

          <h2>Path Finding</h2>

          <h3>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act was passed in 2000.</h3> The main purpose of this act is to provide restraints for security services and the police when investigating and surveying digital data and communications of individuals. The act also makes it a crime for anyone unauthorised by the act to
          carry out surveilance and monitoring of communicatons. The European Court of Human Rights stated that UK surveillance laws were unclear and that there was nothing in place to prevent abuses of power by organisations regarding the interception
          of electronic communications. It was decided that UK surveillance laws and practice must be tighter in order to protect the individual's rights to privacy. As a result, the act was passed.
          <p>
            <p> The idea behind allowing these organisations to intercept and monitor comunications is to achieve the following:
              <ul class="row text-left">
                <li>Prevent or detect crimes</li>
                <li>Prevent public disorder from occurring</li>
                <li>To ensure national security and the safety of the general public</li>
                <li>To investigate or detect any abnormal or illegal use of telecommunication systems.</li>

            <h3>The data protection act was established in 1998. The eight principles are as follows:</h3>
            <ul class="row text-left">
              <li>Personal data should be obtained and processed fairly amnd lawfully </li>
              <li>Personal data can be held only for specified and lawful purposes </li>
              <li>Personal data should be adequate, relevant and not excessive for the required purpose </li>
              <li>Personal data should be accurate and kept up-to-date </li>
              <li>Personal data should not be kept for longer than is necessary </li>
              <li>Data must be processed in accordance with the rights of the data subject </li>
              <li>Appropriate security measures must be taken against unauthorised access </li>
              <li>Personal data cannot be transferred to countries outside the E. U. unless the country has similar legislation to the D.P.A. </li>
            </ul>
            The data protection act is designed to do as it states, ensure the safety of personal data. Each principle aims to keep secure data deemed personal.<br> This includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions and religious beliefs, among
            the obvious such as name and address. In some cases, collection<br> of such material may be required, for example, a Catholic school who only employs Catholics, might wish to know the religious beliefs of new teachers, while<br> The police
            force will need to know if new recruits have any previous criminal convictions.
