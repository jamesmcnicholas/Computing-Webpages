            Graphs can be divided into two categories - Directed and undirected.
            Directed graphs have direction (in the form of arrows) showing the
            path to take. Undirected graphs do not have this propterty, meaning
            there is no outlined path. Trees can be referred to as <b>minimally
            connected directed graphs</b> with only one path from the root node
            to any other node. This works because trees come under the over-arching
            title of graphs.

          <h2>Path Finding</h2>

          <h3>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act was passed in 2000.</h3> The main purpose of this act is to provide restraints for security services and the police when investigating and surveying digital data and communications of individuals. The act also makes it a crime for anyone unauthorised by the act to
          carry out surveilance and monitoring of communicatons. The European Court of Human Rights stated that UK surveillance laws were unclear and that there was nothing in place to prevent abuses of power by organisations regarding the interception
          of electronic communications. It was decided that UK surveillance laws and practice must be tighter in order to protect the individual's rights to privacy. As a result, the act was passed.
          <p>
            <p> The idea behind allowing these organisations to intercept and monitor comunications is to achieve the following:
              <ul class="row text-left">
                <li>Prevent or detect crimes</li>
                <li>Prevent public disorder from occurring</li>
                <li>To ensure national security and the safety of the general public</li>
                <li>To investigate or detect any abnormal or illegal use of telecommunication systems.</li>
              </ul>
