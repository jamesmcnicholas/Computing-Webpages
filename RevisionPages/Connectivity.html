                <h3>Lossy vs lossless compression</h3>
                <ol class="spacing-small" style="text-align: left" >
                    <li>In lossless compression, not every byte of data is stored</li>
                    <li>Lossy compression is used when some data can be missing (e.g. in music files)</li>
                    <li>Lossless compression is used when all data must be preserved (e.g. in a text document)</li>
                    <li>Examples of lossless compression include run-length encoding and dictionary encoding</li>
                </ol>
                <p></p>
                <h3>Run length encoding</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-small">
                    Run length encoding works by countng how many of each repeated data folow each other. Then, this is noted as a shorter way of representing that string of data.
                    For example, 444444 could be compressed into 6 '4's. This method however, is often used for images that do not want to lose any fidelity, such as PNG files.

                <h3>Dictionary encoding</h3>
                <p class='paragraph-small'>
                  Dictionary encoding is another method of lossless compression. It works by assigning values to each individual item in a data set. This method works
                  especially well for files such as text documents. As every word is saved and can be referenced, no data is lost. In documents in which contain a lot of
                  words, this method of compression can vastly reduce file size

                <h3>Huffman Coding</h3>
                  <p class="paragraph-small">
                    Huffman coding is an optimised dictionary encodng method where the frequency of items occuring affects the length of code used to denote them.
                    The more frequently a word is used, Binary trees are structures built by building down from the most frequent words down to the least frequent at the bottom.
                    Each word (assigned to a "node") is referenced by a series of left and right directions reffered to as 1s and 0s. 0 refers to left and 1 refers to right at
                    any intersection. Below demonstrates a basic binary tree for "Happy Birthday to you"

                <h2>Encryption and Hashing</h2>

                <h3>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act was passed in 2000.</h3>
                The main purpose of this act is to provide restraints for security services
                and the police when investigating and surveying digital data and communications of individuals.
                The act also makes it a crime for anyone unauthorised by the act to carry out surveilance and monitoring of communicatons.
                The European Court of Human Rights stated that UK surveillance laws were unclear and that there was nothing in place
                to prevent abuses of power by organisations regarding the interception of electronic communications.
                It was decided that UK surveillance laws and practice must be tighter in order to protect the individual's rights to privacy.
                As a result, the act was passed.
                <p>
                <p> The idea behind allowing these organisations to intercept and monitor comunications is to achieve the following:
                <ul class ="row text-left">
                    <li>Prevent or detect crimes</li>
                    <li>Prevent public disorder from occurring</li>
                    <li>To ensure national security and the safety of the general public</li>
                    <li>To investigate or detect any abnormal or illegal use of telecommunication systems.</li>
