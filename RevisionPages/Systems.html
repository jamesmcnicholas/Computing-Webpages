          <h2>Normalisation</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-small">
            While being able to set up a database with the reqired SQL is functional, many programs such as SQLite or Microsoft Access provide tools to make this easier. However, being able to set up a set of tables isn't what makes a good database; this is where
            normalisation comes in. There are three 'forms' to databases, first, second, and third normal form. Each provides a set of criteria to reduce data inconsistencies and prevent repeated entries.

              <h4 style="background-color:#f99436">First normal form focuses on several key concepts:</h4>
              <li>Each row must be unique (must have a primary key)</li>
              <li>Each field (column) must have a unique name</li>
              <li>Each column must not contain similar or repeated data</li>
              <li>Each data item must not be able to be further broken down (e.g addresses)</li>

            <h2>Referrantial Integrity</h2>
              <p class="paragraph-small">
                Referrantial integrity states that foreign keys should always point to an existing primary key.
                If an operation is going to delete an item with a primary key value that another table's foreign key references,
                there are a few options. The first is to prevent the deletion operation. Another is to set the foregin values
                to null, however this is often prohibited. The final option is to cascade delete all entries that depend on that key.
                This can have unforseen consequences as many entries can be removed.<br><br>
                In many systems, deletion is avoided all together and a "deleted" column is added to
                the table. This way, items can be marked as deleted without actually deleting them and causing conflicts.

            <h2>Database transactions</h2>
            <p class="spacing-small">
              Transactions are how actions are carried out in databases. Each transaction follows the following procedure.
              The transaction begins and is active. It then begins to carry out actions until all are comitted. Once this
              happens, the changes are comitted and the transaction ends. If at any point during the process an action
              fails, the entire transaction is aborted and no changes are comitted. The transaction then ends. This
              must be guaranteed in any situation, including crashes and power failures and is reffered to as <b>atomicity</b><br><br>

              <img src="../img/transaction.png" width="100%">
            </p>
            <h3> Principles of database transactions</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-small" style="">
              <ul>
                <h4 style="background-color:#f99436">The ACID Principle</h4>
                <li><b>A</b> - Atomicity: Transactions should be all or nothing</li>
                <li><b>C</b> - Consistency: All rules of the database must be followed</li>
                <li><b>I</b> - Isolation: The order of transactions shouldn't matter</li>
                <li><b>D</b> - Durability: A comitted transaction must stay comitted</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="spacing-small">
            Atomicity requires that each transaction be "all or nothingâ€œ: if one part of the
            transaction fails, then the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left
            unchanged.
            An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including
            power failures, errors and crashes.
            To the outside world, a committed transaction appears (by its effects on the
            database) to be indivisible ("atomic"), and an aborted transaction does not
            happen.<br><br>
            The consistency property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from
            one valid state to another.
            Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules,
            including constraints, cascades. triggers, and any combination thereof.
            This does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the application
            programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level
            code), but merely that any programming errors cannot result in the violation of any
            defined rules.<br><br>
            The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions
            results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed
            sequentially, i.e., one after the other.
            Providing isolation is the main goal of concurrency control.
            Depending on the concurrency control method (i.e., if it uses strict - as opposed to
            relaxed - serializability), the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be
            visible to another transaction.<br><br>
            The durability property ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will
            remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors.
            In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute,
            the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes
            immediately thereafter).
            To defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be recorded in a
            non-volatile memory.
