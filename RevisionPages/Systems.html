          <h2>Normalisation</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-small">
            While being able to set up a database with the reqired SQL is functional, many programs such as SQLite or Microsoft Access provide tools to make this easier. However, being able to set up a set of tables isn't what makes a good database; this is where
            normalisation comes in. There are three 'forms' to databases, first, second, and third normal form. Each provides a set of criteria to reduce data inconsistencies and prevent repeated entries.

            <ul>
              <h4 style="background-color:#f99436">First normal form focuses on several key concepts:</h4>
              <li>Each row must be unique (must have a primary key)</li>
              <li>Each field (column) must have a unique name</li>
              <li>Each column must not contain similar or repeated data</li>
              <li>Each data item must not be able to be further broken down (e.g addresses)</li>
              <h4 style="background-color:#f99436">Second normal form only applies to tables with composite primary keys:</h4>
              <li>Non-Key attributes must depend on every part of the primary key</li>
              <h4 style="background-color:#f99436">Third normal form builds on second normal form:</h4>
              <li>There are no non-key attributes that depend on another non-key attribute</li>

            <h2>Referrantial Integrity</h2>
              <p class="paragraph-small">
                Referrantial integrity states that foreign keys should always point to an existing primary key.
                If an operation is going to delete an item with a primary key value that another table's foreign key references,
                there are a few options. The first is to prevent the deletion operation. Another is to set the foregin values
                to null, however this is often prohibited. The final option is to cascade delete all entries that depend on that key.
                This can have unforseen consequences as many entries can be removed.<br><br>
                In many systems, deletion is avoided all together and a "deleted" column is added to
                the table. This way, items can be marked as deleted without actually deleting them and causing conflicts.
