                <h3>Databases are a great way of storing and relating relational data. The main language used for databases is SQL</h3>
                <ol class="row text-left" >
                    <li>SELECT - Allows "selection" of a set of data from a database</li>
                    <li>UPDATE - Modifies selected data</li>
                    <li>DELETE - Deletes selected data</li>
                    <li>INSERT INTO - Insert new data into an existing database</li>
                    <li>FROM - Chooses the table from which to select data</li>
                    <li>WHERE - Allows constraints for selection, i.e. WHERE Country="England"</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="paragraph-small">
                    While being able to set up a database with the reqired SQL is functional, many programs such as SQLite or Microsoft
                    Access provide tools to make this easier. However, being able to set up a set of tables isn't what makes a good
                    database; this is where normalisation comes in. There are three 'forms' to databases, first, second, and third normal form.
                    Each provides a set of criteria to reduce data inconsistencies and prevent repeated entries.

                <h3>The data protection act was established in 1998. The eight principles are as follows:</h3>
                <ul class="row text-left">
                    <li>Personal data should be obtained and processed fairly amnd lawfully </li>
                    <li>Personal data can be held only for specified and lawful purposes </li>
                    <li>Personal data should be adequate, relevant and not excessive for the required purpose </li>
                    <li>Personal data should be accurate and kept up-to-date </li>
                    <li>Personal data should not be kept for longer than is necessary </li>
                    <li>Data must be processed in accordance with the rights of the data subject </li>
                    <li>Appropriate security measures must be taken against unauthorised access </li>
                    <li>Personal data cannot be transferred to countries outside the E. U. unless the country has similar legislation to the D.P.A. </li>
                </ul>
                The data protection act is designed to do as it states, ensure the safety of personal data. Each principle aims to keep secure data deemed personal.<br>
                This includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions and religious beliefs, among the obvious such as name and address. In some cases, collection<br>
                of such material may be required, for example, a Catholic school who only employs Catholics, might wish to know the religious beliefs of new teachers, while<br>
                The police force will need to know if new recruits have any previous criminal convictions.
