            <h4 style="background-color:#f9ce36">The five basic OOP principles</h4>
            <li>Code is divided up into <b>objects</b> which contain variables (referred to as <b>attributes</b>) and functions (known as <b>methods</b>)</li>
            <li>Objects are made from "blueprints" called <b>classes</b>. Objects are an instance of a class</li>
            <li>Objects can interact with each other via <b>public</b> methods or attributes</li>
            <li>Methods and attributes can be hidden from other classes by setting them as <b>private</b></li>
            <li>The bundling of methods and attributes into objects with access control is called <b>encapsulation</b></li>

          <p></p>
          <p class="paragraph-small">
            Object oriented code works on dividing up projects into objects, consisting of attributes and methods. Objects are instances of classes, and can interact with each other through public methods or attributes. Object oriented programming is good for modeling
            real life situations. The use of classes and methods allows developers to easily break down problems into much smaller and easier-to-solve chunks. You can encapsulate methods and attributes into objects with access control. Some of the basic
            definitions of OOP terms can be found below.

            <ul>
              <h4 style="background-color:#f9ce36">Some key terms that are essential for OOP</h4>
              <li>Classes and Objects - Classes provide a template or blueprint for objects. Objects are an instance of a class.</li>
              <li>Attributes - Attributes are properties or characteristics of objects, given in the form of variables</li>
              <li>Methods - Methods are actions of objects, given in the form of procedures or subroutines</li>
              <li>Constructor - The default method of a class that creates a new instance of an object</li>
              <li>Access Modifiers - Determine whether parts of the program can be accessed outside their respective class (Public/Private)</li>
              <li>Encapsulation - “Hiding” certain parts of the program from others. This prevents parts of the program outside the class from directly accessing it</li>
              <li>Accessor Methods - Methods that pass private attributes of an object outside the class</li>
              <li>Static vs Instance - Static methods are not linked to a specific object, but instead belong to the class. Instance methods are linked to an instance of a class (A specific object)</li>
              <li>Value vs Reference - Value data types make a copy of the original data and pass that through. This means the original is not affected. By reference data types refer to the memory location of the data, meaning the value changes when updated.</li>
              <li>Refactoring - Changing the layout or format of code to make it more efficient or tidier, but not changing the functionality</li>

          <h2>Recursion</h2>
          <p>
            <h3>Recursion is when a function calls itself</h3>
            <ul class="row text-left">
              <h4 style="background-color:#f9ce36">Principles of recursion</h4>
              <li>Recursion can be used in place of a loop</li>
              <li>There is usually an explicit stopping condition called the <b>base case</b></li>
              <li>The base case should be reached after a finite number of function calls</li>
              <li>If a subroutine is called too many times, it can cause a <b>stack overflow</b> error</li>
              <li>Systems handling recursion require substantial amounts of memory</li>
              <li>However, recursive programs are often shorter than non-recursive equivalents</li>
            </ul>

          Above shows two iterations of a factiorial program written in javascript. The first uses iteration
          in the form of a for-loop; the second uses recursion. While both accomplish the same task, the
          second is significantly shorter. While the system must store more data in memory, this allows
          for a simpler program.

                    <li>Classes can acquire methods and attributes from other classes using inheritance</li>

                    <li><b>Overloading</b> is when different versions of a method with the same name exist to accept different parameters</li>
                    <li><b>Polymorphism</b> describes different behaviour in different contexts due to <b>overriding and overloading</b></li>
                    <li><b>Abstract</b> classes cannot be instantiated, they represent ideas to be inherited by other classes</li>
