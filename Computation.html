                <h3>The computer misuse act came into effect in 1990. It was designed to restrict unauthorised and malicious use of computer systems.
                    The act makes it illegal to carry out any of the following:</h3>
                </p>
                <ol class="row text-left" >
                    <li>Unauthorised access to computer material</li>
                    <li>Unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate a crime</li>
                    <li>Unauthorised modification of computer material</li>
                    <li>Making, supplying or obtaining anything which can be used in computer misuse offences</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="spacing-small">
                    The act works in tiers, so each act has more severe consequences than the last.
                    For example, <br> unauthorised modification of material has worse consequences than basic unauthorised access to data.<br>
                    Before 1990, there was no protection against data theft or modification, meaning there was nothing that could be done <br>  to punish cyber criminals.

                This includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions and religious beliefs, among the obvious such as name and address. In some cases, collection<br>
                of such material may be required, for example, a Catholic school who only employs Catholics, might wish to know the religious beliefs of new teachers, while<br>
                The police force will need to know if new recruits have any previous criminal convictions.

                <h2>Path Finding</h2>

                <h3>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act was passed in 2000.</h3>
                The main purpose of this act is to provide restraints for security services
                and the police when investigating and surveying digital data and communications of individuals.
                The act also makes it a crime for anyone unauthorised by the act to carry out surveilance and monitoring of communicatons.
                The European Court of Human Rights stated that UK surveillance laws were unclear and that there was nothing in place
                to prevent abuses of power by organisations regarding the interception of electronic communications.
                It was decided that UK surveillance laws and practice must be tighter in order to protect the individual's rights to privacy.
                As a result, the act was passed.
                <p>
                <p> The idea behind allowing these organisations to intercept and monitor comunications is to achieve the following:
                <ul class ="row text-left">
                    <li>Prevent or detect crimes</li>
                    <li>Prevent public disorder from occurring</li>
                    <li>To ensure national security and the safety of the general public</li>
                    <li>To investigate or detect any abnormal or illegal use of telecommunication systems.</li>
                </ul>
